# AI-Pac-Man-Projects

## Projects Overview

### P1: Pacman Search
Students implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

### P2: Multi-Agent Search
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Students implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.

### P3: Reinforcement Learning
Students implement model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbookâ€™s Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.

All the source code is written in Python.

## Technical Notes
The Pac-Man projects are written in pure Python 3.6 and do not depend on any packages external to a standard Python distribution.
